The main purpose of this plugin is to force a user to register on your WordPress (and soon BuddyPress) website before they can play on your server. Unlike other plugins that are developed for Forums and have lots and lots of complicated settings, this plugin will be targeted at Word/Buddy press ONLY.\r\n\r\nPossible Uses:\r\n\r\nForce Members to register for your site before they can play\r\nMake users read the rules\r\nUnlock permissions\r\nConfigurable settings:\r\n\r\nDatabase Host, Port, Username, and Password\r\nWordPress Database name\r\nUser Table\r\nWhat to do with un-registered players (kick, freeze, restrict, etc...)\r\nThis is my very first plugin, so any help/ideas/FEEDBACK would be most appreciated!! :) Also, If you would like to help make this the best website-plugin for bukkit, send me a PM ","google":""}
