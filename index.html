        <p>Finally, a simple way to sync your WordPress users to your Minecraft server. The main purpose of this plugin is to force a user to register on your WordPress (and soon BuddyPress) website before they can play on your server. Unlike other plugins that are developed for Forums and have lots and lots of complicated settings, this plugin will be targeted at Word/Buddy press ONLY.</p>

<p>Possible Uses:</p>

<p>Force Members to register for your site before they can play
Make users read the rules
Unlock permissions
Configurable settings:</p>

<p>Database Host, Port, Username, and Password
WordPress Database name
User Table
What to do with un-registered players (kick, freeze, restrict, etc...)
This is my very first plugin, so any help/ideas/FEEDBACK would be most appreciated!! :) Also, If you would like to help make this the best website-plugin for bukkit, send me a PM </p>
